
Introduction

Welcome to Gamercore: The social media platform to unite gamers from all over the globe.

The premise of this build is simple: a facebook/reddit/twitch/discord medium for online or offline gaming enthusiasts . A place where the user can do the following:

- Find like minded players for multiplayer/online games or to simply chat and follow.

- Share their opionions and thoughts on the games they enjoy

- Show off their heightlights, cool gaming moments and much more.

- Watch and keep upto date with their favourite Streamers/Content creators


Well, if it isn't obvious: I am a gamer. As a gamer, I always found myself stretched to thin between different apps to keep up with the games I enjoy. Discord to chat with friends and join clubs , reddit for community posts plus general discussion and twitch/youtube to watch my favourite streamers/content creators. So I figured, why can't I just have one app to do all this? Therefore, I browsed the web for such an app (News Flash: It doesn't exist).

It suprises me that no one has actually done this , so I had to do it. Giving birth to GamerCore (I will probably change the name one day).


Technologies

-ReactJS

-HTML/CSS

-TypeScript

-Firebase


Much of the backend is handled by firebase , so this is a project mostly emphasisng my frontend skills and my use of react hooks

React is very good in breaking down large ideas into smaller and connected components, which is why I went for it. I would like to implement a lot of features into this which can quickly become tangled up if I don't find a way to organise them . Typescript will aid me in catching errors that JavaScript wouldn't have caught and Firebase would do most of the backend for me , allowing me to focus on the features of this site.


Features


Here is a list of the features that I have added so far:

- A feed page that allows the user to see the posts that other players have shared. The user can select a post/like it or comment if they want

- A search feature that would allow the user find other players they may know and check their profiles out

- A LFG feature to find other players to game with

- The ability to share a new post to discuss the game (feed) or find other players (LFG)


Features I would like to include:

- Form validation and some responsive design modifications  

- The ability to see streams of popular twitch streamers (using twitch api)

- A sign up page for new users to get in (at the moment, it is just a demo account)

- A messaging system to connect with other players, make group chats and send friend requests

There are many more I can go through but for the time being, these will take the majority of my attention. As I add new features, I will update this list.
